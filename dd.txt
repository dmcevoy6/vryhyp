to my darling grace

This may of not of been the best year overall, but i 
wouldnt change a thing as it all lead to me meeting you, 
my best friend and lover. Nothing feels like
too much or too little to talk to you about, and I
couldnt imagine spending my days without having you to talk to. 
I couldn't not get you anything for christmas so even though 
its not much i hope you like the relationship bracelet 
(ngl theyre pretty cute i have one in black and they connect
magnetically hehe)
.
Thank you darling for giving me hope in happily ever after 
again and dont let it be too long before i see my baby again :)

Wishing you a happy christmas and hope my princess gets spoiled 

I love you always
Dan <3
